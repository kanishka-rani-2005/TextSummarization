# === Core NLP & Modeling ===
transformers[sentencepiece]  # Pretrained models like BART, T5 + SentencePiece support
datasets                     # HuggingFace datasets like CNN/DailyMail, XSum
sentencepiece                # Tokenizer backend used by T5, mT5
torch                        # Backend for PyTorch models
nltk                         # Tokenization, sentence splitting, and ROUGE

# === Utility & Preprocessing ===
pandas                       # Data handling and preprocessing
tqdm                         # Progress bars during training/inference
PyYAML                       # Config file parsing (.yaml)
python-box==6.0.2            # Dot notation access to dicts
ensure==1.0.2                # Lightweight runtime assertions
